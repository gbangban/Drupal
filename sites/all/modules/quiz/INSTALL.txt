Installation
------------

1. Copy the entire quiz/ folder into your modules directory.

2. Log in to your site as an administrator, and go to the Administer >> Site building >> Modules
   section. Enable both the Quiz module and at least one question type module
   (for example, Multichoice).

3. You can optionally install quiz views module for an enhanced UI

   **NOTE: The permissions for views are handled seperately, each view must be configured for the
   appropriate level of permission. 


Configuration
-------------

1. Create a user role with "create quiz" and "administer <question_type>"
   permissions. The role can be created under Administer >> User management >> Roles and the rights can be assigned to the role under Administer >> User management >> Access control.
   Assigning users to this role allows users other than the administrator to 
   create questions and quizzes.
   
2. Add the "access quiz" permission to roles under Administer >> User management >> Access control that should be allowed to take the quizzes.


How to create a quiz
--------------------

1. Begin by creating a series of questions that you would like to include in 
   the quiz. Go to Create content >> <question type> (for example, Multichoice).
   
2. Next, create a basic quiz by going to Create content >> Quiz. You will have 
   the opportunity to set numerous options such as the number of questions, 
   whether or not to shuffle question order, etc. When finished, click "Submit."
   
3. Finally, add questions to the quiz by clicking the "Manage questions" tab.
